## Let's talk: "An intelligent conversational system for emotional well-being"

The solution consists of the development of a conversational system (chatbot) supported by AI, which provides information for depression diagnoses and through the case study presented manages to provide support to medical students in the early identification of depression management by evaluating the usability and contribution to decision making with the help of experts in the field. The implementation of this solution seeks to integrate biological, psychological and cultural aspects in its approach, seeking to break the stigma associated with this type of disorders and provide free access to this relevant information.

 ## Objectives of the Project
    

**General Objective:** To develop a conversational system (RPA) based on Artificial Intelligence algorithms to support the diagnostic process focused on depression, using as a field of study the medical students of the Universidad El Bosque and managing to evaluate the usability and the contribution to decision making with the help of experts in the field.

  

**Specific Objectives:**

  

-   Conduct an analysis of the training context of doctors in the final stage of their training in Basic and Fundamental Sciences at El Bosque University in order to understand the problem domain and thus achieve the requirements of the solution..
    
-    Determine the design and architecture of the solution based on the information obtained from the previous analysis to understand the solution components and their relationships by understanding the data and its preparation..
    
-   To apply the modeling process in the construction of an expert system based on a conversational system in order to support the diagnosis of depressive mental disorder.
    
-   Execute a test plan on the information system and the integrated decision support model, in order to analyze the effect on the perceived usability of the solution in the context of feedback to medical students in the final stage of their Basic and Fundamental Sciences training at El Bosque University..
