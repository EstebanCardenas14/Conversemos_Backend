CHAPTER Depression Madeline Li FRCPC Joshua Rosenblat Gary Rodin FRCPC The risk of developing depressive disorders is increased in most chronic medical conditions and reciprocally depression can be a risk factor for the development of medical illnesses Ramasubbu et al  There are multiple nonspecific factors such as disability and physical suffering that may increase the risk of depression in serious medical illnesses There is also speculation about whether specific biological mechanisms account for the comorbidity of depression with particular medical conditions Depression is frequently underdiagnosed and untreated in medical settings despite its frequency negative effects on health and responsiveness to treatment This diagnostic and therapeutic neglect may be due to underreporting of symptoms because of stigma difficulty distinguishing normative from pathological distress physical symptom overlap between depression and medical illness and lack of sufficient caregiver training in or comfort with mental health inquiry There may also be mistaken beliefs among both providers and patients about the untreatability of depression that is Untreated depression is of concern in medical populations because it is associated with greater somatic symptom burden Katon et al and worse quality of life Katon in common medical disorders Depression is also associated with higher rates of health care utilization such that the cost of medical care for depressed medical patients is higher than that for nondepressed medical patients depressed patients also tend to be less compliant with medical treatment and to have less functional capacity and less occupational productivity Unützer et al  Paradoxically depression is also overdiagnosed in medical settings with unnecessary prescription of antidepressant medication for nonpathological sadness or grief or diagnoses based solely on scores on depression screening instruments In this chapter we review the prevalence and clinical features of depression in the medically ill discuss approaches to depression screening diagnosis and treatment and explore mechanisms that may account for the etiology course and outcome of depression in the medical setting We do not attempt to provide information on depression in particular diseases for details on the effects of comorbid depression in various medical conditions readers are referred to the chapters on specific disorders in this textbook The Continuum of Depression From Experience to Disorder Sadness is a normal expectable response to the adverse effects of a serious medical illness including changes in bodily appearance and functioning pain and physical distress limitations in the capacity to work and to engage in pleasurable activities perceived alteration in the anticipated life trajectory fears of disability and dependency and alterations in intimate relationships family life social relationships and other activities Nonpathological sadness and grief lie at one end of the continuum of depression in medical populations In the middle lie subthreshold depressions Rodríguez et al which are the most prevalent depressive presentations among medically ill patients Gellis At the more severe end are depressive symptoms that clearly meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder as specified in American Psychiatric Association These categorical distinctions have heuristic and communicative value although the boundaries that demarcate and distinguish them from one another are somewhat arbitrary and often difficult to determine particularly in medically ill patients The eight major categories of depressive disorders specified in are major depressive disorder MDD persistent depressive disorder PDD formerly dysthymia depressive disorder depressive disorder due to another medical condition disruptive mood dysregulation disorder applicable only in children premenstrual dysphoric disorder other specified depressive disorder formerly minor or subsyndromal depression and unspecified depressive disorder when insufficient information is available to make a specific diagnosis Subthreshold disorders including PDD and the other specified and unspecified depressive disorder categories may substantially reduce quality of life and result in moderate functional impairment Rowe and Rapaport At least of subthreshold depressions progress to MDD Lyness et al  no longer excludes recent bereavement from a diagnosis of MDD although it should be noted that normative and nonpathological grief following a loss may meet all diagnostic criteria for a depressive episode Horwitz and Wakefield Indeed it may be argued that the onset exacerbation or progression of a serious medical illness may be experienced as a loss that can be at least as distressing as the loss of a loved one Notably a diagnosis of adjustment disorder which in is reconceptualized as one of the and disorders can be applied when a patient has symptoms of depression in reaction to a stressor such as medical illness that do not meet criteria for MDD or PDD The operational criteria for this diagnosis including what constitutes an excessive response to the multiple and chronic stressors of medical illness are not clear However despite this ambiguity the heuristic and nonstigmatizing appeal of the category of adjustment disorder contribute to its being one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses made in medical patients Li et al  Epidemiology Depressive disorders are extremely common in the general population with up to of adults in the United States having had at least one episode of MDD during their lifetime Kessler et al and suffering from a current MDD Ferrari et al  Medical illness has consistently been shown to be a risk factor for depression Patten et al  PDD and subthreshold depression are the most common depressive syndromes in medical populations reported in up to of medical outpatients a rate several times higher than that in the general population Rowe and Rapaport The prevalence of MDD varies by population with rates of in community samples in primary care settings and in medical inpatient settings these progressive increases presumably are based on differences in medical disease severity Burvill Similarly the risk of a depressive episode in patients in primary care Barkow et al and in the community Wilhelm et al rises with the number of comorbid medical diseases The reported prevalence rates of depressive disorders in specific medical conditions including cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD stroke epilepsy multiple sclerosis Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease are listed in Table TABLE Prevalence of depression in selected medical illnesses Medical illness Prevalence of MDD MDD subthreshold depression References Cancer Mitchell et al Diabetes Musselman et al Roy and Lloyd Type Type Heart disease Rudisch and Nemeroff Schleifer et al Van Lieshout et al Arseniou et al Stroke Morris et al Robinson and Jorge Epilepsy Fiest et al Multiple sclerosis Boeschoten et al Alzheimer s disease Chi et al Lyketsos et al Parkinson s disease Goodarzi et al Note obstructive pulmonary disease depressive disorder FIGURE Pathways to depression Although depression is often regarded as a discrete disorder it can also be considered as a final common pathway of distress that arises from the interaction of biological psychological and social factors Biological factors interact with the psychological impact of the disease which is filtered through the prism of individual and interpersonal strengths to result in a range of depressive responses from normal sadness to major depressive disorder Etiology Increased rates of depressive symptoms and depressive disorders have been found in virtually all chronic medical conditions in which depression has been studied Patten et al  It has been hypothesized that specific biological mechanisms lay the foundations for depression in certain medical conditions including hypothyroidism stroke Parkinson s disease diabetes and some types of cancer Although specificity for depression has not been substantiated in any of these conditions each is associated with multiple nonspecific risk factors that may increase the prevalence of depression In fact depression in the context of medical illness is a prime example of the biopsychosocial model of disease with interacting pathophysiological and psychosocial factors contributing to comorbidity The final common pathway to from the interaction of psychological and social risk and protective shown in Figure Potential biological contributors to depression in medical illness include the physical effects of illness and treatment medications neurological involvement genetic vulnerability and systemic inflammation In this regard greater pain and treatment intensity Patten et al more advanced disease Manne et al and proximity to death Lo et al have all been shown to increase the risk of depression Individuals with a genetic vulnerability to depression are also more likely to develop it in the context of medical illness Levinson and common genetic vulnerabilities may account for the frequent comorbidity of depression and Alzheimer s disease Kim et al Parkinson s disease Mössner et al and coronary artery disease Su et al  systemic inflammation Miller et al manifesting as sickness behavior is another proposed common pathophysiological mechanism that may underlie depression in a wide range of medical disorders including cancer Raison and Miller cardiovascular disease Parissis et al diabetes Musselman et al Alzheimer s disease Leonard stroke Arbelaez et al multiple sclerosis Wallin et al asthma Van Lieshout et al and infectious diseases such as Leserman This association has led some to posit the existence of a specific subtype of depression ICAD Lotrich characterized by more neurovegetative and fewer core psychological symptoms Capuron et al Pasquini et al is more common in individuals with medical conditions associated with inflammation Dantzer et al  It has been suggested that depression is symptomatically different from MDD with less prominent and milder depression and atypical features more characteristic of ICAD Patten and Barbui The association of depression with medications such as calcium channel blockers analgesics nonsteroidal drugs isotretinoin and phenobarbital has largely been based on case reports with few studies Valid evidence linking medications to atypical depressive syndromes has been found only for corticosteroids hormone agonists mefloquine and implanted contraceptives Patten and Barbui Most of these drugs and their psychiatric side effects are discussed in other chapters of this textbook Psychosocial factors that may contribute to the development of a comorbid depressive disorder in medical illness include the stigma and personal meaning of the medical condition disability Talbot et al maladaptive coping styles Wallin et al low impaired spiritual Rodin et al and reduced capacity to express affect Classen et al  Low social support Lewis and poor communication with medical caregivers Gurevich et al also increase the likelihood of a comorbid depressive disorder Additionally expectations of support and the capacity for flexible use of social support captured in the construct of attachment security may provide protection against the emergence of depressive symptoms in medically ill patients Rodin et al  Age is inversely related to the severity of depressive symptoms Gottlieb et al  Although depression in the general population has been strongly associated with female gender Lucht et al this gender difference has not been found consistently in depression in medical populations Miller et al Rodin et al  It may be that the overriding common stressors related to the medical illness obliterate differences that would otherwise emerge Clinical Features and Diagnosis The diagnosis of depressive disorders in medical populations is fraught with difficulties that include the following Many physical symptoms of medical illness fatigue anorexia weight loss insomnia psychomotor retardation diminished concentration resemble those of depression In addition a variety of emotional disturbances such as emotionalism pathological crying apathy and fatigue in poststroke patients Bogousslavsky or in patients with multiple sclerosis Chwastiak and Ehde can be mistaken for depression It may also be difficult to distinguish depression from the apathy associated with hypoactive delirium or dementia or from akinesia and masked facies in Parkinson s disease  Thoughts of death and the desire for death in patients with advanced medical disease have been associated with depression and demoralization in the terminally ill Breitbart et al  However such thoughts must be distinguished from adaptive death acceptance or an attempt at cognitive mastery that does not reflect depression Nissim et al   Physical suffering and disability in the absence of comorbid depression may diminish the capacity to experience pleasure in many formerly enjoyable activities Depressed mood or withdrawal from social or physical activities that is disproportionate to physical disability increases the likelihood that the loss of pleasure is secondary to depression  In medical populations depressive symptoms may manifest in atypical or masked forms including amplification of somatic symptoms Katon et al and noncompliance with or refusal of medical treatment DiMatteo et al  These symptoms or behaviors may not be recognized as manifestations of depression leading to underdiagnosis of depression  The categories of MDD depressive disorder and depressive disorder due to another medical condition may overlap in the context of medical illness The latter two diagnoses imply that the etiology of the depression is a direct physiological consequence of the specified general medical condition or substance whereas the causation of depression is most often multifactorial Various approaches have been proposed to diminish the confounding effect of medical symptoms in the diagnosis of MDD In it is acknowledged that there are no infallible guidelines to follow in determining when depression is secondary to another medical condition but that the index of suspicion should be raised by a temporal association between symptoms and the onset exacerbation or remission of a medical condition and an age at onset course or absence of family history that is atypical for a primary mood disorder The criteria for determining which symptoms are due to a medical illness and which are due to other factors unrelated to the medical illness are unclear and are left to the clinician s best judgment American Psychiatric Association A combined exclusive and etiological approach to the diagnosis of depression in patients with medical illness was previously advocated with exclusion of symptoms judged by the clinician to be etiologically related to a general medical condition or not more frequent in depressed than nondepressed patients with such conditions Bukberg et al  This approach was intended to avoid attributing symptoms of physical illness to a depressive syndrome The exclusive approach is usually applied only to the somatic symptoms of depression although this does not take into account that depressed medical patients report significantly more physical symptoms than matched nondepressed medical patients Fitzgerald et al  Evaluating the rates of depression in hospitalized elderly medical patients according to six different diagnostic schemes Koenig et al found no overall advantage of one diagnostic scheme over others In cases in which the diagnosis remains unclear a focus on the qualitative differences of psychological features on the continuum of depression Table along with a trial of treatment as appropriate may be the most practical means of resolving the question TABLE Psychological features on the continuum of depression Normal sadness Subthreshold depression major depressive disorder Maintenance of intimacy and connection Belief that things will get better Capacity to enjoy happy memories Sense of fluctuating with thoughts of cancer Capacity to look forward to the future Retention of capacity for pleasure Low mood presentation similar to major depressive disorder but not meeting full criteria for symptom number or duration Feeling of isolation Feeling of permanence Excessive guilt and regret Constant pervasive and nonreactive sadness Sense of hopelessness Maintenance of will to live Potentially transient and including mood episodes lasting weeks Includes persistent depressive disorder if years duration Loss of interest in activities Suicidal Source Adapted with permission from Li Kennedy Byrne et al The Management of Depression in Patients With Cancer A Quality Initiative of the Program in Care PEBC Cancer Care Ontario CCO Guideline Toronto ON Canada Cancer Care Ontario Health Outcomes The bidirectional comorbidity between depression and medical illness is evidenced by the increased risk of acquiring certain medical conditions in patients with a prior history of depression MDD has been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease to Van der Kooy et al stroke Ramasubbu and Patten cancer Gross et al diabetes Yu et al epilepsy to Hesdorffer et al and Alzheimer s disease Green et al  These risk increases may be mediated by biological mechanisms as well as by unhealthy behaviors related to medical compliance diet or exercise Katon The World Health Organization WHO recently reported that depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide with more than million people affected globally World Health Organization Remarkably the WHO World Health Survey Moussavi et al found that depression reduces overall health significantly more than do chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease arthritis asthma and diabetes and that the comorbid state of depression plus medical illness worsens health more than any combination of chronic diseases without depression Comorbid depression is associated with a significant economic burden including almost twofold higher rates of health care utilization and workplace disability Stein et al longer inpatient lengths of stay Saravay et al and at least a twofold increase in emergency room visits Himelhoch et al  Comorbid depression is also associated with a threefold greater risk of nonadherence to medical treatment thereby contributing to increased morbidity and mortality DiMatteo et al  Such noncompliance may include not taking treatments that are prescribed not following diet or lifestyle recommendations and not appearing for medical appointments Comorbid depression and medical illness have been shown to be associated with worse medical outcomes and higher mortality rates in a number of medical conditions but specific causal relationships between depression and such outcomes have not been confirmed Cuijpers et al  Depression has been associated with more rapid progression of HIV disease Leserman and with increased mortality in cardiovascular disease Carney and Freedland cancer Batty et al Pinquart and Duberstein organ transplant Dew et al and diabetes Park et al  This increased mortality rate which persists even after factors such as smoking disease severity and alcohol consumption Schulz et al are controlled for may be attributable to several different factors Biological mechanisms in depression may increase mortality rates in the medically ill via effects on the autonomic nervous system and on related cardiac outcomes The association of suicide with depression may also increase mortality rates in medical populations a finding that has been demonstrated in medical conditions such as cancer Steel et al multiple sclerosis Stenager et al and Huntington s disease Almqvist et al  Depression may be associated with other health risk as cigarette smoking overeating physical inactivity obesity and excess alcohol increase the prevalence of associated medical illness and affect its course adversely Screening for Depression Obstacles to Diagnosis in Medical Settings Depression and other forms of distress are commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated in medical settings Fallowfield et al  A study suggested that fewer than of cases of depression are correctly diagnosed by general practitioners Mitchell et al  This finding warrants concern because a missed diagnosis of MDD may represent a lost opportunity to improve quality of life decrease the risk of suicide shorten hospital stay and improve treatment compliance in the medically ill There are many explanations for the low rate of detection of clinical depression in medical settings The structure of medical medical visits often lasting less than minutes with multiple clinical concerns that may need to be addressed during each visit and the frequent lack of privacy in clinic and hospital inhibit disclosure or elaboration of symptoms Furthermore some clinicians avoid emotional inquiry because they fear that they lack sufficient time or skill to manage emotional reactions Some patients are reluctant to disclose depressive symptoms because of perceived stigma or anticipated lack of interest of their medical caregivers However most patients welcome the opportunity to discuss psychosocial issues that are raised by their health care providers Rodin et al  In some cases both patients and clinicians have difficulty differentiating the somatic symptoms of depression from those of medical disease Even when clinically significant depression is recognized as being present it may be perceived as an understandable reaction to medical illness and therefore not worth treating Paradoxically medical clinic visits that preclude adequate assessment of mood can lead to the overdiagnosis of depression and unnecessary pharmacotherapy This may be a result of misattribution of the symptoms of physical illness to depression and use of low diagnostic thresholds for depression with an overreadiness to prescribe antidepressant medications to refer for specialized psychiatric assessment Boland et al because of inadequate resources or training to explore or manage psychological distress Aragonès et al  More appropriate utilization of limited specialized psychiatric resources may be facilitated by routine use of validated depression screening tools in medical settings Cahill et al Caruso et al Gill et al Hermanns et al McCollister Moraes et al Quittner et al Swartz et al as has been recommended for primary care by the Preventive Services Task Force with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis effective treatment and appropriate O Connor et al  Screening Process General Considerations Screening for depression may be particularly helpful in medical settings where routine assessment of mood might otherwise not occur The ideal screening instrument would be easy to administer and score acceptable to patients and most importantly accurate However the utility of screening for depression depends not only on the measure used but also on whether screening results are routinely assessed by medical caregivers and followed up with appropriate and effective intervention Failure to ensure that such a response loop is implemented partially contributes to the paucity of evidence that depression screening results in improved depression outcomes Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care et al Thombs et al  The WHO s principles of screening for disease Andermann et al require that medical screening tests demonstrate evidence of effectiveness with benefits outweighing harms Screening for depression differs from screening for conditions such as cancer because of the recurrent nature of depression where early identification may not necessarily reduce incidence in the context of chronic medical illness Furthermore positive primary screening tests only identify individuals with a high risk for a medical condition and must be followed by appropriate secondary assessment to make a diagnosis When positive depression screens automatically trigger intervention inappropriate use of mental health resources or overprescription of antidepressants may occur The goal of depression screening should be to initiate a clinical assessment by the health care provider Li et al  Screening Instruments Commonly Used in Medical Populations There is no true gold standard for the diagnosis of depression particularly in the context of medical illness but clinical interviews have traditionally been used to confirm diagnoses and to establish prevalence rates Such interviews may be unstructured utilizing an inclusive or substitutive approach to counting symptoms or more structured utilizing diagnostic instruments such as the Structured Clinical Interview for Version First et al the Composite International Diagnostic Interview CIDI World Health Organization the Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI Sheehan et al the Present State Examination PSE Hall et al or the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Spitzer et al  Depression rating scales can be used to screen patients to identify those who require clinical diagnostic assessment or to measure depression severity and symptom change over time Numerous psychometric measures have been developed to measure depressive symptoms with criterion validity and optimal cutoff scores usually established with some form of clinical interview Wakefield et al  The cutoff scores selected determine the sensitivity and specificity of the measure and therefore the proportion of and cases Use of higher cutoffs that avoid false positives may be preferable for research purposes and for determining resource allocation in more severe cases Lower thresholds may be preferable in treatment settings in which a premium is placed on avoiding false negatives and on detecting subthreshold disorders In the following paragraphs we briefly discuss four commonly used instruments that have been validated in medical populations Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale Radloff Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS Zigmond and Snaith Beck Depression II Beck et al and Patient Health Kroenke et al  The HADS and the are copyrighted instruments while the and the are available in the public domain The is a measure of depressive symptoms in which only of the items are somatic Originally designed as a measure of depressive distress in community samples the has also been extensively used in medically ill samples with evidence of good psychometric properties A cutoff score of was originally recommended to identify clinically significant depression Radloff but the low positive predictive value of the suggests that it might be a better measure of general distress than of depression Reported cutoff scores in a variety of medical populations have varied between and Depending on cutoffs and medical illness sensitivity ranges from to and specificity from to The HADS is a scale specifically designed for use in the medically ill with separate subscales for anxiety and depression The depression subscale emphasizes anhedonia and does not include somatic items The HADS is highly acceptable to patients and has been extensively used in the medically ill with reported cutoff scores ranging from to Depending on cutoffs and medical illness sensitivity ranges from to and specificity from to The HADS does not discriminate well between depression and anxiety and like the it may be better used as a measure of emotional distress Cosco et al Norton et al  The was originally developed as a measure of symptom severity in psychiatric patients but this instrument has been used in numerous studies in the medically ill Concerns have been raised about its validity in patients with medical illness because of its preponderance of somatic items and about the acceptability to patients of its format and complex response alternatives Koenig et al  However there are many studies of the as a screening instrument in medically ill samples that have found it to be an accurate measure Wang and Gorenstein The cutoff scores recommended in the medically ill have ranged widely from to providing sensitivity ranging from to and specificity ranging from to depending on the medical condition Wang and Gorenstein The the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire has been studied in thousands of primary care and medical specialty outpatients in the United States Europe and China The measures each of the nine criteria for a major depressive episode with scores ranging from not at all to nearly every day Reported cutoff scores used in medical populations have ranged from to Depending on cutoffs and medical illness sensitivity ranges from to and specificity from to Levis et al  Of note Levis et al identified significant reporting bias in studies using the as primary study authors often only selectively report results from cutoffs that perform well in their study and Very Brief Screening Scales screening tests for depression have wide appeal to health care providers and patients but not surprisingly they have poor positive predictive value in medical settings Mitchell Mitchell and Coyne Kroenke et al evaluated the which was derived from the studies using the have reported sensitivity and specificity estimates of and respectively in a primary care population Mitchell et al and and respectively in a geriatric population Tsoi et al  The lower specificity of or measures of depression limits their utility although measures such as the which focuses on the core features of depressed mood anhedonia may be useful particularly in a fashion However the most common shortcoming in the detection of depression is not in the nature of the instrument used or in the questions posed but rather in the failure to screen for depression using any method Treatment Outcomes Although the negative impact of depression on illness is unequivocal and the bidirectional relationship between depression and medical illness is strong evidence that treatment of depression improves medical outcomes is less clear In an analysis of studies evaluating the benefits of a strategy for depression in diabetes heart failure and coronary artery disease Sharkey et al found no evidence of improved chronic disease outcomes However Katon et al demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial RCT that patients with depression and chronic illness poorly controlled diabetes coronary artery disease or both receiving collaborative care had greater overall improvements in hemoglobin lipoprotein cholesterol systolic blood pressure and depression scores compared with those receiving usual care The question of whether treatment of depression improves medical outcomes has been most extensively investigated in cardiovascular disease and cancer in which several studies have explored the relationship between treatment of depression and survival In cardiovascular disease no beneficial effects on cardiac outcomes were found in studies of psychotherapeutic interventions such as the Montreal Heart Attack Readjustment Trial and the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients ENRICHD Berkman et al trial although these studies may have been underpowered to detected significant differences given the modest effectiveness of treatment Randomized trials of pharmacological treatment for depression in cardiovascular disease such as the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial SADHART Glassman et al and a related trial regarding congestive heart failure O Connor et al and the Myocardial INfarction and Trial van den Brink et al of mirtazapine also failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in risk for cardiac events although these studies similarly demonstrated little reduction in depression However in a subanalysis of subjects in the ENRICHD trial there was reduced risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in subjects who received antidepressants particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs adjusted hazard Similarly secondary analysis of the subgroup of patients in the trial who achieved clinical remission of depression demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events compared with the nonremission group adjusted Jiang et al  Beneficial pleiotropic effects of SSRIs such as reduction in platelet activity Serebruany et al and improvement in heart rate variability Yeragani et al may account for these findings Notably one large study of enhanced depression treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome demonstrated a reduction in major adverse cardiac events in intervention patients compared with patients Davidson et al  Unique aspects of this study were a flexible treatment model in which patients could choose therapy antidepressants and selection for persistent months depression A better understanding of the temporal and mechanistic relationships between depression and coronary artery disease is needed to clarify potential medical effects of antidepressant treatment Dickens et al see also Chapter Heart Disease Studies have yet to be published on medical outcomes associated with treatment of MDD in cancer patients although such outcomes have been assessed in studies in which threshold depression was not an inclusion criterion In an RCT of a course of fluoxetine versus placebo in stage breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy Navari et al reported that fluoxetine reduced depressive symptoms improved quality of life and increased the likelihood of completion of adjuvant treatment The question of whether psychotherapy can improve survival in cancer has been a hotly debated one Coyne et al Kraemer et al with trials demonstrating that psychosocial interventions that are effective in reducing depressive symptoms do not confer a survival benefit in metastatic cancer patients Jassim et al Kissane et al see also Chapter Oncology It may be that the effectiveness of currently available treatments for depression in medical illness is too limited to shift the physiological disease burden of advanced illness enough to alter survival outcomes More effective treatments may be needed to determine whether alleviation of depression in medical illness has a significant impact on survival and to identify biologically plausible mechanisms that could account for such an effect Emphasis instead should be on improving quality of life FIGURE model of depression care with treatment intensity corresponding to depression severity aComplex depression includes depression that shows an inadequate response to multiple treatments is complicated by psychotic symptoms is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity or psychosocial factors Source Reprinted from Li M Kennedy EB Byrne N et al Management of Depression in Patients With Cancer A Clinical Practice Journal of Oncology Practice content from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Treatment Several studies have reported that both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions are effective in treating depression in patients with medical disorders although these effects may be less robust than those in individuals with MDD without medical comorbidity Iosifescu The latter finding may be due not only to a difference in the response of MDD to treatment but also to the more prevalent subthreshold presentations in medical populations which tend not to respond to antidepressant medications Baumeister and for which optimal treatment approaches are less clear Rowe and Rapaport The primary evidence base for the effectiveness of treatment of depression in specific medical conditions is limited Most systematic reviews and analyses have demonstrated modest benefit in illnesses including diabetes Baumeister et al coronary artery disease Baumeister et al COPD Panagioti et al cancer Li et al HIV infection and AIDS Sherr et al chronic kidney disease Grigoriou et al stroke Nabavi et al multiple sclerosis Fiest et al dementia Ford and Almeida and Parkinson s disease Troeung et al  All such reviews comment on the limited evidence base and the need for more RCTs of depression treatments Most current depression treatment guidelines recommend the use of both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions based on pooled evidence of benefit in medical populations and extrapolation from effectiveness in primary psychiatric populations Goodarzi et al Li et al Lichtman et al Relf et al Towfighi et al  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE has synthesized the available evidence on the treatment of depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health UK Updated guidelines published in November identified a few new treatment trials but none that altered NICE s recommendations for a approach to depression management National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Stepped care is a framework for care delivery in which treatment is graded to the severity of depression Figure All patients with depression are provided with basic assessment support psychoeducation monitoring and referral Step Based on evidence that the ratio does not support the use of antidepressant medications in subthreshold depression less intrusive and psychological or psychosocial interventions are provided first Step with progression to the next step of medications psychological interventions Step which may be delivered within a collaborative care model Archer et al if there is inadequate response to initial treatment Complex depression involving suicide risk psychosis or severe psychosocial risk may require inpatient admission brain stimulation therapies The components of these interventions are described more fully below Psychotherapeutic Treatment The full range of psychosocial interventions designed to treat depression in medical populations is discussed in more detail in Chapter Psychotherapy and in the chapters on specific disorders in this textbook The model suggests use of psychosocial interventions for persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression interventions include structured group physical activity programs peer support or programs individual guided programs based on therapy CBT and computerized CBT Such therapies may protect patients from depression by diminishing stigma and feelings of isolation and by promoting and a sense of mastery Patients with inadequate response to treatment or with initial presentations of moderate to severe depression should be offered psychosocial interventions that are professionally facilitated Such interventions include individual or group CBT or behavioral couples therapy A Cochrane review of psychotherapy for depression in patients with incurable cancer concluded that psychotherapy was effective in decreasing depressive symptoms although no studies were identified that focused specifically on patients with MDD Akechi et al  Although the preponderance of research evidence supports behavioral approaches to treatment of depression in medical illness Baumeister et al Hummel et al Jassim et al Orgeta et al Ski et al such approaches are rarely adopted in routine clinical practice More commonly an individualized eclectic approach is used combining elements of psychoeducation behavioral activation problem solving interpersonal therapy therapy and expressive psychotherapy delivered on an individual or a group basis The relationship with the primary medical caregiver may be the most important psychotherapeutic tool to prevent or treat depression for many patients with a serious medical illness Specific psychological therapies may alleviate or prevent depression without the risk of physical side effects or drug interactions and may help to modify health behaviors that adversely affect disease outcomes The indication to refer to a mental health professional for psychotherapy will depend on the severity of the depression and on the skill and availability of practitioners The specific psychotherapeutic intervention selected should also take into account the available support network and the patient s capacity to learn new coping strategies to engage in a process that may involve introspection and the expression of feelings Unique features of psychotherapy in the medically ill are the importance of collaborative relationships between the therapist and the medical caregivers the likelihood of frequent disruptions in treatment due to complications of the disease and the need for flexible treatment goals that accommodate shifts in the patient s physical and capacity to participate In more advanced disease issues related to hope existential and advance care planning may be prominent Rodin et al  Replicated evidence has demonstrated moderate antidepressant effects of psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with cardiovascular disease Ski et al Whalley et al diabetes Baumeister et al Musselman et al cognitive impairment Orgeta et al van Luenen et al multiple sclerosis Fiest et al Wallin et al heart failure Freedland et al hemodialysis Xing et al and stroke et al  Numerous systematic reviews and of psychosocial interventions in cancer have found treatment effects for depressive symptoms Williams and Dale and systematic reviews of psychosocial interventions for categorical diagnoses of MDD Li et al Williams and Dale also demonstrate a treatment effect in RCTs although the number of studies in these reviews is small Newly emerging therapies including Psychotherapy Breitbart et al Dignity Therapy Chochinov et al and CALM Therapy Lo et al have shown benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with advanced cancer although the effectiveness of these therapies in treating MDD has yet to be demonstrated In summary studies of psychotherapeutic interventions to treat depression in a variety of medical populations indicate some degree of effectiveness which is often improved in more severe depression when psychotherapy is combined with antidepressant medication Numerous other nonspecific psychotherapeutic and educational interventions also may be effective in reducing and preventing depressive symptoms Psychopharmacological Treatment SSRIs heterocyclic antidepressants and tricyclic antidepressants TCAs novel antidepressants and psychostimulants have been evaluated in the treatment of depression comorbid with medical illness All antidepressants are discussed fully in Chapter Psychopharmacology here we summarize key points SSRIs are generally regarded as the pharmacological treatment for depression in medically ill patients because of their tolerability and relative safety although antidepressants have become increasingly popular in this population because of the potential for dual benefits arising from their profiles Venlafaxine is effective for hot flashes in breast cancer Loprinzi et al venlafaxine duloxetine and milnacipran are effective for the treatment of pain syndromes Jann and Slade mirtazapine may be useful in treating nausea insomnia and anorexia de Boer and bupropion may be particularly useful in treating patients with prominent neurovegetative symptoms such as fatigue Raison et al  Vortioxetine and vilazodone are multimodal serotonin modulator and stimulator antidepressants recently approved for use in the treatment of MDD Vortioxetine may have procognitive effects Rosenblat et al but they have yet to be evaluated in medical populations TCAs such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline have been shown to be effective as analgesics in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes and insomnia see Chapter Pain Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil Ballon and Feifel have been reported to rapidly alleviate depressive symptoms in a range of medical conditions including stroke Grade et al HIV disease Fernandez et al and cancer Andrew et al Conley et al  Many consider psychostimulants to be the antidepressants of choice in the palliative care setting because of their rapid onset of action Wilson et al however the evidence remains mixed with both positive Ng et al and negative Centeno et al Sullivan et al trials in palliative care A Cochrane review Candy et al suggested that the improvement in depression that occurs with psychostimulants may not be clinically significant Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and quetiapine are effective as augmenting agents in the treatment of MDD in the general population although this effect has not been studied in medical populations However antipsychotics used for this purpose may have additional benefits by stimulating appetite relieving nausea improving sleep and alleviating perceptual disturbances associated with delirium Brain Stimulation Therapies Electroconvulsive therapy ECT is sometimes used in the medically ill to treat severe or refractory depression Beale et al  It has been shown to be effective in improving depression in Parkinson s disease and also may improve the symptoms of the Parkinson s disease itself Borisovskaya et al it has also been shown to improve poststroke depression and depression associated with multiple sclerosis endocrine disorders and renal failure Krystal and Coffey ECT has been associated with improvements in cognition and mood in patients with dementia Rao and Lyketsos and is considered safe for epilepsy patients with severe or refractory depression Lambert and Robertson ECT should be considered early in the course of depression with psychosis or catatonia and for depression associated with severe suicidal ideation or failure to maintain adequate nutritional status ECT and its risks are reviewed in detail in Chapter Electroconvulsive Therapy and Other Brain Stimulation Therapies Similarly repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS which does not produce the memory impairment associated with ECT is sometimes used as an alternative to pharmacotherapy with growing evidence supporting its use in the medically ill Replicated evidence more than RCTs supports a robust antidepressant effect of rTMS for depression alone and in specific medical populations Brunoni et al  In a recent Shen et al identified RCTs all in China patients of rTMS for poststroke depression The results demonstrated that rTMS had a positive effect with high antidepressant response and remission rates and improvement in activities of daily living Likewise in a of eight RCTs evaluating the effects of rTMS for depression in Parkinson s disease Xie et al found a positive pooled antidepressant effect for rTMS versus sham rTMS and an equivocal antidepressant effect for rTMS versus SSRIs Furthermore patients who received rTMS showed improvement in symptoms of Parkinson s disease and in performance of activities of daily living compared with patients who received sham rTMS or SSRIs Taken together there is growing evidence to support the use of rTMS for depression in medically ill patients particularly those with neurological disorders McIntyre et al  Collaborative Care At a systems level of care there is now strong evidence to support the effectiveness of collaborative care models for the treatment of depression in cancer Sharpe et al Walker et al coronary artery disease Atlantis et al diabetes Tully and Baumeister multiple sclerosis Ehde et al and hepatitis C Kanwal et al  Whereas the model suggests use of collaborative care for either refractory or moderate to severe depression recent studies have supported the clinical and cost effectiveness of collaborative care for subthreshold depression as well Gilbody et al Lewis et al  For further information on collaborative care see Chapter Conclusion Clinical depression is common in the medically ill and is associated with impaired quality of life decreased compliance with medical treatment and increased medical morbidity and mortality The elevated prevalence of depression in the medically ill is most often the result of multiple risk factors although there is continued speculation that specific biological mechanisms operate in certain medical conditions The diagnosis of depressive disorders in medical patients is complicated by the frequent overlap between symptoms of depression and those of medical illness This overlap may contribute to underdiagnosis when symptoms of depression are assumed to be features of the medical condition or to overdiagnosis when symptoms of a medical illness are attributed to depressed mood However the neglect of simple inquiry about the symptoms of depression may be the most common reason that the diagnosis of depression is overlooked in medical patients Screening tests may be useful for drawing the attention of clinicians to these symptoms and identifying patients in medical settings who are most likely to have depressive disorders Psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches are both effective in the treatment of depressive disorders in the medically ill and are often even more effective when used together in
